# sikuliator-master-node

This is the central repository for Sikuliator.
It contains the implementation of the central master node which offers a web interface and manages everything.

Sikuliator is currently developed.
A first working version is expected for january 2016.

## Documentation

The complete documentation of all Sikuliator's master node and client is contained in this repository for simplicity reasons.
This will probably change in the future.

Currently it contains the master node's draft api spec v0.0.1 and the client's basic finite state machine.
